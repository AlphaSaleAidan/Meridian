## ADR-001: Supabase for Auth + Multi-Tenant Data

**Decision:** Use Supabase Auth for authentication and Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security for multi-tenant data isolation.

**Why:**
- Supabase Auth provides email/password, magic links, OAuth, and JWT out of the box
- RLS enforces data isolation at the database layer — impossible to bypass from the application
- Reduces custom auth code to near zero
- Scales to thousands of business tenants without schema changes
- Built-in rate limiting, audit logging, and session management

**Trade-off:** Vendor lock-in on Supabase. Mitigated by using standard PostgreSQL — can migrate to self-hosted Supabase or raw Postgres if needed.

## ADR-002: Token-Based Portal Provisioning

**Decision:** Sales team generates a single-use access token per business. Customer redeems the token to activate their portal.

**Why:**
- Decouples the sales process from engineering — no manual database work needed
- Token is the handoff artifact between sales and the customer
- Single-use + 30-day expiry prevents token sharing or stale invites
- Works for both during-sale setup (sales rep enters token) and post-sale self-service (customer uses link from email)

**Alternative considered:** Direct signup without token. Rejected because we need to tie each account to a specific plan tier, max locations, and billing agreement before portal access.

## ADR-003: Three Authentication Paths

**Decision:** Support three ways for a business to access their portal:

1. **Email + Password** — standard login for returning users
2. **Access Token** — first-time activation during/after sale
3. **Demo mode** — no auth required, uses client-side mock data

**Why:**
- Path 1 handles 95% of daily logins
- Path 2 handles the critical onboarding moment
- Path 3 lets prospects explore without commitment
- `/demo` routes are always open; `/app` routes require auth; `/portal` is the gate

---

## ADR-004: Business-Scoped Data Namespace

**Decision:** Every data query is scoped to `business_id`. No global queries exist in the customer-facing app.

**Why:**
- Prevents any possibility of data leakage between tenants
- RLS policies on every table enforce this at the DB level
- Application code always passes `business_id` from the auth context
- Demo mode uses a synthetic `org_id = 'demo'` that returns client-side mock data

---

## ADR-005: Role-Based Access (Owner / Manager / Staff)

**Decision:** Three roles per business with decreasing access levels.

**Why:**
- Owner: full access including billing, user management, data upload
- Manager: can see all analytics but cannot change billing or add users
- Staff: can only see their assigned location's performance data
- Keeps the dashboard relevant per role — staff don't need to see billing; managers don't need user management

**Implementation:** `business_users.role` column, checked in the React auth context. RLS policies filter data by role where needed.

---

## ADR-006: Automated Onboarding Pipeline

**Decision:** The onboarding sequence is fully automated from token generation through first insights.

**Why:**
- Reduces time-to-value from days to hours
- No manual engineering work required per customer
- `onboarding_progress` table tracks each step with timestamps
- If any step stalls (e.g., no data upload after 72h), automated alerts trigger

**Sequence:** Token generated → Welcome email → Token redeemed → Portal created → POS connected → Data imported → Agents run → Insights delivered → Customer marked Active

---

## ADR-007: Client-Side Demo Data with Server-Side Production Data

**Decision:** Demo mode generates all data client-side in `demo-data.ts` and `agent-data.ts`. Production mode hits the FastAPI backend which queries Supabase.

**Why:**
- Zero server cost for demos and prospects
- Demo works offline and loads instantly
- Production data flows through proper API with auth headers
- Same React components render both — only the data source changes
- `isDemo(orgId)` check in `api.ts` routes to the correct path

---

## ADR-008: 15-Agent Swarm Triggered on First Data

**Decision:** All 15 AI agents run automatically when a business's first batch of POS data is imported.

**Why:**
- Delivers immediate value — customer sees insights within hours of connecting
- Agents run in dependency order (transaction-analyst first, action-prioritizer last)
- Results stored in the business's isolated data namespace
- Subsequent runs are scheduled (hourly for critical agents, daily for others)

---

## ADR-009: Session Security Model

**Decision:** 24-hour standard sessions, 30-day "Remember Me" sessions, 60-minute inactivity timeout.

**Why:**
- 24h default balances security and convenience for daily users
- 30-day "Remember Me" prevents re-login fatigue for trusted devices
- 60-minute inactivity timeout protects shared/public computers
- "Log out all devices" in settings provides emergency session revocation
- All sessions stored in `customer_sessions` with device info for audit trail

---

## ADR-010: Login Rate Limiting

**Decision:** 5 failed attempts per 15 minutes per email or IP address.

**Why:**
- Prevents brute force attacks
- Per-email protects individual accounts
- Per-IP prevents credential stuffing across accounts
- Implemented as a PostgreSQL function (`check_login_rate_limit`) for server-side enforcement
- `login_attempts` table provides full audit trail
